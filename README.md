# RStudioShiny-nginx
## Wrapper script for installing R, RStudio Server, Shiny Server all behind an nginx reverse proxy

This script assumes you have a pretty clean Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04 or 24.04 LTS install.

We will:
* Add the official R 4.4 respository
* Add the APT keys for this repository
* Install R (r-base and r-base-dev)
* Download and install RStudio Server
* Install and configure nginx (more on this below)
* Install the shiny R package
* Download and install Shiny Server
* Configure Shiny Server (more on this below)


Once complete you'll have:
* nginx default home page being served on port 80 (http://127.0.0.1)
* RStudio Server being served on port 8787 and also as a virtual directory (http://127.0.0.1:8787 & http://127.0.0.1/rstudio)
* Shiny Server being served on port 3838 and also as a virtual directory (http://127.0.0.1:3838 & http://127.0.0.1/shiny)
* Shiny Server is being run as the user that installed it (little bit weird but makes it easy for the user)
* Shiny Server is being run out of the users home directory (~/shiny) (little bit weird but makes it easy for the user)
* Shiny Server can host multiple apps and will present an initial index page, an index entry gets created for every folder in ~/shiny (If you only want to host a single app then just delete the sample app folder in ~/shiny and publish your application directly into there)

## Instructions
### Installation
Simply download and run the install-rstudioshinynginx.sh script. This should be as simple as:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jb2cool/RStudioShiny-nginx/main/install-rstudioshinynginx.sh
bash install-rstudioshinynginx.sh
```

### Updating
Occasionally you'll want to update to newer versions of R, RStudio Server, Shiny Server and nginx. R and nginx would likely have already been updated by your regular update schedule on your machine but since RStudio Server and Shiny Server were downloaded and installed manually these need a more manual approach to update them. Use the update script to update to the latest versions of all programs. Simply download and run the update-rstudioshinynginx.sh script. This should be as simple as:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jb2cool/RStudioShiny-nginx/main/update-rstudioshinynginx.sh
bash update-rstudioshinynginx.sh
```

## Cautions
* The install script will overwrite your /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default file, if you have already made customisations to this file ensure you have a backup.
* The install script manually creates your R personal library so that it can install the Shiny package, this shouldn't have any impact if you already have a personal library but it's untested.
* This is designed for ease-of-use on a single-user machine, if this is a multi-user machine then this is probably not the approach to take. This is because Shiny Server will be running out if one users home directory and RStudio Server will refuse to allow users to log in unless their home directory already exists.
* Don't run the update script from within RStudio-Server itself, if you do you'll end up pulling the rug from under your own feet, do this from a separate session.
